## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're building something together.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see README.md)
4. Create a feature branch from `main`

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run trading-floor
```

### Frontend

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-agent` - New features
- `fix/streaming-timeout` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - Documentation
- `refactor/api-routes` - Refactoring

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use Ruff for linting (`uv run ruff check backend/`)
- Keep functions focused and well-documented

#### TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Run `bun lint` before committing
- Use functional components with hooks

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line should be under 72 characters
- Reference issues when relevant

Examples:
```
